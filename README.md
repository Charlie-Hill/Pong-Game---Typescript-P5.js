# üèì Pong Game
This is my recreation of the classic Pong game written in Typescript using the P5.js library (with Typescript support). The game features basic Pong mechanics with the goal of ensuring the ball does not get past your paddle.

I wrote this to further develop my Typescript skills as well as 2d canvas drawing and very basic game engine & mechanics.
